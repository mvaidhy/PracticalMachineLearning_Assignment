Final Assignment for Coursera course Practical Machine Learning

This work has been done to meet the requirments for the final assignment for the Coursera class "Practical Machine Learning". 

We are working with a dataset that was collected from multiple devices that were worn by a set of weight lifters. These sensors measured
various motion parameters (speed, acceleration, etc.) in all six dimensions. The idea behind this data collection is to see 
whether one can detect if the wearer is using the correct technique (labeled Classe "E" in the data) based on the device 
measurements.

The markdown file has all the details.
